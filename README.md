This site receives a list of information from the JSONPlaceholder api, renders it with React, and stores the information with Redux through React Redux. Lodash and Thunk was used to reduce the number of repetitive api calls to the JSONPlaceholder api, and the google maps was used to place a small map with the coordinates of each user in their information card.
